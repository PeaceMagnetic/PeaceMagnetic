👀 I’m interested in programming applications that enhance device performance and user experience. My projects often involve creating tools that give users more control, such as custom folder icon changers, dynamic desktop slideshow applications with flexible timing, and advanced speech recognition apps that allow voice control of various software. Additionally, I'm passionate about learning more about the world we live in, exploring diverse traditions, religions, and the human experience on Earth.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced AI integration, UX/UI design, and cross-platform development to further improve my projects.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what software can do for users, especially in areas like automation, personalization, and accessibility.
